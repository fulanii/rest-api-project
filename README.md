# Rest API Project
In this project i built a rest API with python and flask, I first scraped country data online. Then stored the data in a PostgreSQL database, finally I've made the data available with a rest api. With the api you can access countries info like: ``` name, capital, population, area size, country code and country iso code.```

## Endpoints 
- 3 GET, 3 POST and 1 PUT endpoint
