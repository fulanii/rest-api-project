# Rest API Project
In this project i built a rest API with python and flask, I first scraped and cleaned country data online. Then stored the data in a PostgreSQL database, I've made the data available with an api. Using the api you can access countries info like: ``` name, capital, population, area size, country code and country iso code.```

Finally I made a country fun fact table where you can add a fun fact about any country using a ```POST```request, or edit/update the fun fact with a ```PUT``` request.
